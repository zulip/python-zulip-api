# commit_notice_destination() lets you customize where commit notices
# are sent to with the full power of a Python function.
#
# It takes the following arguments:
# * repo   = the name of the git repository
# * branch = the name of the branch that was pushed to
# * commit = the commit id
#
# Returns a dictionary encoding the stream and subject to send the
# notification to (or None to send no notification).
#
# The default code below will send every commit pushed to "main" to
# * stream "commits"
# * topic "main"
# And similarly for branch "test-post-receive" (for use when testing).
